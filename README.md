### Machine Learning Publications in NASA Represented Fields

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/423582609.svg)](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.13023913)

This is a collection of scripts that analyze the prevalence of machine learning in NASA science related literature. The original data source can be found at the Scopus literature [database](https://www.scopus.com/home.uri).

The figure here was first computed for [Azari et al., 2021](https://baas.aas.org/pub/2021n4i128/release/1?readingCollection=7272e5bb) and has since been updated. As based on this figure, it is estimated that currently (in 2023) planetary science has seen approximately half as many applications of machine learning methods as in Earth science (7.5% vs 14.3% of publications).

If you use this figure please reference the published paper and specify the version of the respository used for example (Azari et al., 2021, v2023.0.2). Sample Bibtex is given below.
